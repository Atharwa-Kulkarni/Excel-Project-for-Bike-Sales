# Excel-Project-for-Bike-Sales

This is a portfolio project for learning Excel, where I have analyzed an Bike Sale Data 

The skills I learned while completing this Project are: 
*Data Cleaning 
*Data Processing 
*Data Analysis 
*Data Visualization

Data Cleaning:- To check whether the data is correct or not. Whether it has any inconsistencies, blanks, spelling errors, extra spaces, or any other error.

Data Processing:- Depending on the Questions we have to answer, we need to arrange the data in some specific format, so Data Processing is done.

Data Analysis:- Creation of Pivot Tables and solving the questions are done in this section.

Data Visualization:- Creating Charts or Pie-Diagrams to create a full-fledged report is done in Data Visualization.
